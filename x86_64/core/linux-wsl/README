## IMPORTANT!!!

* Always change linux.install kernel version strings!!!

## Why not just automate kernel version string search from /lib/modules?
* Doing it may break the automation if
    * User has added some .ko files manually that bottle wont remove ( meaning the old kernel dir will be there with new one )
